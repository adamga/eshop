# Vulnerability Monitoring and Management Process Documentation

## Purpose
To comply with PCI Secure Software Standard C.1.6, all third-party components and services used by the eShop web application and its supporting infrastructure are continuously monitored for vulnerabilities, and any known vulnerabilities are patched or otherwise mitigated as quickly as possible.

## Process
- GitHub Advanced Security (GHAS) is enabled for this repository.
- GHAS automatically scans all direct and transitive dependencies (NuGet, npm, Docker images, etc.) for known vulnerabilities using Dependabot and GitHub's security advisory database.
- Security alerts are generated in the GitHub Security tab when vulnerabilities are detected.
- The development team reviews and triages all security alerts promptly.
- Vulnerable dependencies are updated and patched as soon as possible, following the project's change management process.
- All vulnerability management activities are tracked in GitHub Issues and Pull Requests for auditability.

## Evidence
- Security alerts and Dependabot PRs in the GitHub Security tab.
- Issue and PR history showing vulnerability remediation actions.
- Audit logs of GHAS scans and alert resolutions.

## Review
- The process is reviewed periodically to ensure vulnerability monitoring and remediation is effective and up-to-date with current tooling and project structure.
