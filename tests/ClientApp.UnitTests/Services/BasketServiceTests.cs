/**
 * BasketServiceTests.cs
 * 
 * Test Purpose:
 * This test class validates the functionality of basket-related services in the eShop client application.
 * It focuses on testing the integration between basket services and catalog services to ensure proper
 * data retrieval and basket management operations.
 * 
 * How the Test Works:
 * 1. Uses MSTest framework with [TestClass] and [TestMethod] attributes for test structure
 * 2. GetFakeBasketTest method performs the following:
 *    - Creates an instance of CatalogMockService to simulate catalog data access
 *    - Calls GetCatalogAsync() to retrieve catalog items (which may be used for basket operations)
 *    - Validates that the result contains data by asserting the count is not equal to zero
 * 3. Tests the integration between catalog and basket services to ensure basket operations
 *    have access to necessary product catalog data
 * 
 * Note: Despite the class name "BasketServiceTests", this test currently validates catalog service
 * functionality that supports basket operations. This may indicate the test needs expansion to
 * include direct basket service testing or the class name may need clarification.
