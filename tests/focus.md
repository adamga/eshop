# 🛡️ PCI Secure Software Test Plan (Web Application Focus)

This test plan aligns with the PCI Secure Software Standard v1.2.1 and is tailored for web applications. It prioritizes code-first controls, assigns responsibilities by role, and provides a structured approach to testing.

---

## 🔷 Phase 1: Code-First Security Controls (Developer-Led)

These controls are primarily implemented and testable through code and should be your **top priority**.

| Priority | Control Objective | Description | Test Activities | Primary Role | Supporting Roles |
|---------|-------------------|-------------|------------------|--------------|------------------|
| 1 | C.3.2 / 4.2 | Input Validation & Attack Mitigation | Validate all user inputs, sanitize outputs, prevent injection (SQLi, XSS, etc.) | Web Developer | Security Architect |
| 2 | C.2.1 / 5.1–5.4 | Authentication & Access Control | Enforce MFA, unique IDs, session management, least privilege | Web Developer | QA, Security |
| 3 | C.3.1 | HTTP Security Headers | Implement CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options, etc. | Web Developer | QA |
| 4 | C.4.1 / 6.2 | Secure Transmission | Enforce HTTPS, TLS 1.2+, mutual auth for APIs | Web Developer | DevOps |
| 5 | C.3.4 / C.3.5 | File Upload & Object Deserialization | Restrict file types, scan uploads, prevent hostile object creation | Web Developer | QA |
| 6 | C.2.2 / C.2.3 | API Access Control | Enforce fine-grained access to APIs and resources | Web Developer | Security |
| 7 | 7.1–7.4 | Cryptography Use | Use strong algorithms, secure key storage, RNGs | Web Developer | Security Architect |
| 8 | 3.1–3.5 | Data Retention & Deletion | Minimize retention, securely delete sensitive data | Web Developer | QA |
| 9 | 6.1 / 6.3 | Data at Rest Protection | Encrypt sensitive data, secure key management | Web Developer | DevOps |
| 10 | C.1.1–C.1.5 | SBOM & Dependency Tracking | Maintain SBOM, track third-party libs | Web Developer | DevOps |

---

## 🔷 Phase 2: Operational & Lifecycle Controls (Shared or Non-Code)

These controls involve **processes, infrastructure, or documentation** and are typically led by other roles.

| Priority | Control Objective | Description | Test Activities | Primary Role | Supporting Roles |
|---------|-------------------|-------------|------------------|--------------|------------------|
| 11 | 10.1–10.2 | Threat & Vulnerability Management | Run SAST/DAST, track CVEs, patch management | Security | DevOps, Developer |
| 12 | 11.1–11.2 | Secure Updates | Validate update integrity, notify stakeholders | DevOps | Developer |
| 13 | 8.1–8.4 | Activity Tracking | Log access to sensitive data, ensure traceability | DevOps | Developer |
| 14 | 9.1 | Attack Detection | Detect anomalies, brute-force, config changes | Security | DevOps |
| 15 | 12.1 | Implementation Guidance | Provide secure config docs to stakeholders | Developer | Product, Security |
| 16 | C.1.6–C.1.7 | Third-Party Component Security | Monitor CDNs, verify fetched code | DevOps | Developer |
| 17 | A.1–A.2 | Account Data Protection | Mask PAN, prevent SAD storage | Security | Developer |
| 18 | B.1–B.5 | Terminal Software (if applicable) | POI device-specific controls | N/A | N/A |

## ✅ Role Responsibilities Summary

| Role | Primary Responsibilities |
|------|--------------------------|
| **Web Developer** | Input validation, access control, cryptography, secure defaults, SBOM |
| **QA/Test Engineer** | Functional security testing, file upload abuse, session handling |
| **Security Architect** | Threat modeling, cryptographic review, attack detection |
| **DevOps** | TLS enforcement, logging, secure deployment, update delivery |
| **Compliance/Product** | Documentation, stakeholder guidance, audit readiness |

## 🧪 Sample Test Case Template

```markdown
### Test Case: Input Validation – SQL Injection
- **Control**: C.3.2 / 4.2
- **Test Type**: Manual + Automated (DAST)
- **Steps**:
  1. Submit SQL payloads in form fields (e.g., `' OR 1=1--`)
  2. Observe response and logs
- **Expected Result**: Input is sanitized or rejected; no SQL error or data leakage
- **Tester**: Web Developer
- **Status**: ✅ Pass / ❌ Fail
```
