# PCI Compliance Test Failures - Diagnostic Report

**Date:** 2025-06-13

## Summary
This document records the root causes and diagnostic steps for recent PCI compliance test failures in the eShop solution. Each failed test is listed with its observed behavior, likely root cause, and next diagnostic steps.

---

## 1. Test: Input Validation and Injection/XSS Protection (Login Username Field)
- **Test File:** `e2e/PciC3_2_InputValidation.spec.ts`
- **Failure:**
  - XSS payload (`<script>alert(1)</script>`) and SQLi payload (`' OR 1=1--`) are reflected in the value attribute of the username input after a failed login attempt.
  - No code execution or stack trace, but raw input is present in the returned HTML.
- **Root Cause:**
  - The login form does not HTML-encode user input before reflecting it in the form field, allowing unsanitized input to appear in the HTML response.
- **Compliance Impact:**
  - This is a potential XSS risk and a PCI C.3.2 compliance gap.
- **Next Diagnostic Steps:**
  1. Locate the login form markup/component in the codebase.
  2. Identify how the username value is rendered in the form.
  3. Ensure server-side HTML encoding is applied to all reflected user input.

## 2. Test: Add/Remove Item and Login Setup Failures
- **Test Files:**
  - `e2e/AddItemTest.spec.ts`
  - `e2e/RemoveItemTest.spec.ts`
  - `e2e/login.setup.ts`
- **Failure:**
  - Tests time out or fail to find expected UI elements (e.g., login heading, add to cart button).
- **Root Cause:**
  - The login step fails, possibly due to UI changes, selector mismatches, or the production site being unavailable or slow.
- **Compliance Impact:**
  - Automated e2e coverage is incomplete until login reliability is restored.
- **Next Diagnostic Steps:**
  1. Manually verify the login page and selectors in the production environment.
  2. Update Playwright selectors to match the current UI.
  3. Confirm the production site is healthy and responsive.

## 3. Test: HTTP Security Headers
- **Test File:** `e2e/PciC3_1_SecurityHeaders.spec.ts`
- **Failure:**
  - The `x-content-type-options` header is missing from the main page response.
- **Root Cause:**
  - The web server or app is not configured to send this recommended security header.
- **Compliance Impact:**
  - This is a PCI C.3.1 compliance gap.
- **Next Diagnostic Steps:**
  1. Review web server and app configuration for security headers.
  2. Add the `x-content-type-options: nosniff` header to all responses.
