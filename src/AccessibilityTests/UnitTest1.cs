/**
 * UnitTest1.cs
 * 
 * Test Purpose:
 * This is a placeholder unit test file for accessibility testing. Currently contains a single
 * empty test method that serves as a template for future accessibility-related unit tests.
 * 
 * How the Test Works:
 * 1. Contains a basic test structure using xUnit framework (indicated by [Fact] attribute)
 * 2. The Test1() method is currently empty and serves as a placeholder
 * 3. This file is intended to be expanded with specific accessibility validation tests
 * 4. Future tests would typically validate WCAG compliance, keyboard navigation, screen reader
 *    compatibility, and other accessibility requirements
 * 
 * This test file provides the foundation for accessibility testing within the eShop application
 * and should be expanded with concrete accessibility validation logic.
