## Introduction

To ensure reliable and accurate electronic payment transactions, the systems and software used as part of the payment transaction flow must be designed, developed, and maintained in a manner that protects the integrity of payment transactions and the confidentiality of all sensitive data stored, processed, or transmitted in association with payment transactions. This document, the _Payment Card Industry (PCI) Secure Software_

_Requirements and Assessment Procedures_ (hereafter referred to as the “PCI Secure Software Standard” or “this standard”) provides a baseline of security requirements with corresponding assessment procedures and guidance for building secure payment software.

The _PCI Secure Software Standard_ is intended for use as part of the PCI Software Security Framework (SSF). Entities wishing to have their payment software validated under the PCI SSF would do so to this standard.


### Stakeholder Roles and Responsibilities

There are numerous stakeholders involved in maintaining and managing PCI standards. The following describes the high-level roles and responsibilities of these stakeholders as they relate to the PCI Software Security Framework:

**PCI SSC** – Responsible for maintaining the standards, supporting programs, and related documentation associated with the PCI Software Security Framework including, but not limited to:

- Maintaining the PCI Secure Software Standard (this document).
- Maintaining all supporting documentation including reporting templates, attestation forms, frequently asked questions (FAQs), and guidance to assist entities implementing and assessing to this standard.
- Providing instructions and guidance for SSF Assessors in accordance with the requirements and assessment procedures in this standard.
- Maintaining a list of all SSF Assessors qualified to perform assessments to this standard (on the [PCI SSC Website)](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/).
- Maintaining a quality assurance program for SSF Assessors.

**Participating Payment Brands** – Responsible for developing and enforcing their respective compliance programs related to PCI standards including, but not limited to:

- Defining and enforcing requirements, mandates, and deadlines for compliance to the PCI Secure Software Standard (this document).
- Determining the entities that are required to comply with this standard.
- Specifying the validation methods and frequency.
- Identifying and enforcing any fines or penalties for non-compliance.

**SSF Assessor Companies** – Responsible for maintaining the required knowledge, expertise, and equipment necessary to execute all assessment activities, adhering to all SSF Assessor Qualification Requirements, performing assessments to this standard, and generating the assessment report documenting the results. Note that not all SSF Assessor Companies are qualified to perform assessments to this standard. For more information on assessment activities and assessor qualification requirements, refer to the _PCI Secure Software Program Guide_ and _Qualification Requirements for SSF Assessors_, respectively.

**Payment Software Vendors / Providers / Developers** – Responsible for developing, distributing, maintaining, and operating (where applicable) payment software, and ensuring that their payment software meets all applicable security requirements defined in this standard.

## Overview of PCI Secure Software Standard

The security requirements defined within the _PCI Secure Software Standard_ ensure that payment software is designed, engineered, developed, and maintained in a manner that protects payment transactions and data, minimizes vulnerabilities, and defends against attacks.

### Scope of Security Requirements

The security requirements defined in this standard describe the security characteristics, controls, features, and capabilities that payment software must possess to protect the integrity of payment functions and the confidentiality of sensitive payment data. The payment software features that are in scope for these requirements include, but are not limited to:

- All end-to-end payment software functionality, including:

− All payment functions.

− Inputs and outputs.

− Handling of error conditions.

− Interfaces and connections to other files, systems, and/or software.

− Data flows.

− Security mechanisms, controls, and countermeasures, such as authentication, authorization, validation, parameterization, segmentation, logging, and so on.

- Processes used by the software vendor, provider, or developer to identify and support software security controls.
- Guidance that the software vendor, provider, or developer is expected to provide to stakeholders that describes:

− How to implement and operate the payment software securely.

− All configuration options available that can impact the security of payment software, including those of the execution environment and related system components.

− How to implement security updates.

− How and where to report security issues to the software vendor, provider, and/or developer.

_Note that the software vendor, provider, or developer may be expected to provide such guidance even when the specific settings:_

− Cannot be controlled by the payment software vendor, provider, or developer after the software is installed in a production environment.

− Are the responsibility of the implementing entity and not the software vendor, provider, or developer.

- Any other software, software functionality, or services necessary for a full implementation of the payment software, including but not limited to:

− Third-party and open-source software functions, libraries, packages, components, services, and dependencies embedded in or relied upon by the payment software to provide its intended function.

− Features and functions of a supported platform or the execution environment relied upon by the payment software for security purposes.

− Third-party or custom tools and functions relied upon by the payment software to satisfy security requirements in this standard.

### Requirement Modules

The PCI Secure Software Standard includes the concept of requirement “modules,” which are distinct groups of requirements relating to a specific topic or type of software. Modules are intended to clarify how and when specific requirements apply to a given payment application or function.

The requirements in this standard are organized into the following four requirement modules:


- **Module C – Web Software Requirements (“Web Software Module”)**: Additional security requirements for payment software that uses Internet technologies, protocols, and languages to initiate or support electronic payment transactions.

#### Requirement Module Applicability

Each requirement module includes its own applicability criteria. It is expected that software assessed to this standard will include assessment to all applicable modules. At a minimum, payment software must be assessed to the Core Module. Additional modules are included in the assessment when the software meets the applicability criteria for those additional modules. Refer to the “Purpose and Scope” section within each additional module for more information on module applicability criteria.

Be aware that some requirements defined within individual modules are extensions of Core Module requirements. Where such relationships are noted, the requirements in modules should be assessed in conjunction with their associated “Core” requirements.

Also note that there may be certain requirements defined within a module that are similar to requirements in other modules or that may have broader applicability beyond the module(s) where they are defined. Unless otherwise noted, such requirements are required to be assessed only in the context of that module. With that said, such requirements are likely to be consolidated and/or applied more broadly in future updates to this standard. Entities are encouraged to identify and apply requirements that may be applicable to an entity’s payment software regardless of whether the entity is required to assess to the module where such requirements are defined.

### Objective-Based Approach to Requirements

The PCI Software Security Framework has adopted an “objective-based” approach to defining the security requirements in this standard. The PCI SSC acknowledges that there is no “one size fits all” approach to software security and that software vendors need flexibility to determine the software security controls and features most appropriate to address their specific business needs and risks.

An “objective-based” approach is one that states security requirements as a desired security goal or outcome without necessarily specifying the method(s) to be used to achieve the desired goal. This approach enables entities to implement software security controls based on the risks identified by the software vendor for a given software application. For this approach to be successful, software vendors must possess a robust risk-management practice as an integral part of their software development lifecycle (SDLC) and be able to demonstrate how the implemented security controls are supported by the results of their risk identification and management practices. Without a robust risk-management practice in place and evidence available to support risk-based decision making, adherence to the requirements defined in this standard may be difficult to validate.

#### Requirement Frequency and Rigor

Given the nature of PCI SSC’s objective-based approach to security requirements, many security requirements do not specify the level of rigor or frequency for periodic or recurring activities, such as the maximum period in which a security update must be provided to fix known vulnerabilities. In such cases, the software vendor may define the level of rigor or frequency appropriate for its business needs. The level of rigor or frequency chosen, however, must be supported by documented risk assessments and the resultant risk management decisions. Additionally, the software vendor must demonstrate that its implementation provides ongoing assurance that the software security controls and activities are effective and satisfy all relevant control objectives.

### Requirement Structure

The security requirements defined in this standard are as follows:

- **Control Objectives** – The high-level security objectives that must be met. Control objectives are broadly stated to provide software vendors the flexibility to determine the best method(s) to achieve the stated objective. Regardless of the method(s) chosen, it is expected that the software vendor be able to produce clear and unambiguous evidence to demonstrate that the chosen method(s) is/are appropriate, sufficient, and properly implemented to satisfy the objective.
- **Test Requirements** – The expected assessment activities to be performed by an assessor to determine whether a specific control objective has been met. Test requirements are intended to provide both the software vendor and assessor with a common understanding of the tasks expected to be carried out by the assessor during testing. The specific method(s) used, the item(s) examined, and the personnel interviewed must be appropriate for the control objective being validated and for the software being assessed.
- **Guidance** – Additional information to help payment software vendors and assessors understand the intent of each control objective. The guidance may also include best practices that should be considered and examples of controls or methods that may be used to satisfy the control objective. Guidance is not intended to preclude other methods that a software vendor may use to meet a control objective, nor does it replace or amend the control objective to which it refers.



## Module C – Web Software Requirements

| **Module Name** | **Overview** | **Control Objectives** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Module C: Web Software Requirements** | Additional security requirements for payment software that uses Internet technologies, protocols, and languages to initiate or support electronic payment transactions. | **C.1**: Web Software Components & Services<br><br>**C.2**: Web Software Access Controls<br><br>**C.3:** Web Software Attack Mitigation<br><br>**C.4**: Web Software Communications |

### Purpose and Scope

This section (hereinafter referred to as the “Web Software Module” or “this module”) defines security requirements and assessment procedures for payment software and applications that use Internet technologies, protocols, and languages for the purposes of initiating or supporting electronic payment transactions. This includes both traditional (monolithic) and cloud-native payment applications, APIs, web services, microservices, serverless functions, GRPC, and any other methods used to make payment functions accessible or to conduct electronic payment transactions over the Internet. Any software-based features or functions that handle requests from Internet “clients” and generate responses to initiate or support an electronic payment transaction are in scope for the requirements in this module.

### Considerations

Web software architectures can be extremely complex and involve features and functions that are provided by different entities and may be distributed across different geographic locations. The security issues affecting web software can vary significantly. The security requirements defined within this web module do not address all risks affecting web-based payment software. They are intended as a minimum set of security characteristics, controls, features, and capabilities that web-based payment software must possess to defend itself from the most common attacks on web software.

While many of the control objectives defined in this standard protect against new and/or novel attacks beyond the most common techniques, attacks will inevitably evolve or emerge that will require new methods or approaches to mitigate them. It is ultimately the responsibility of payment software vendors, providers, developers, and suppliers to keep abreast of evolving attacks techniques and to implement appropriate security controls to enable their software to defend against such attacks.

Identifying all of these different relationships can be challenging where there are many different third-party components nested in the software code.<br><br>Fortunately, many software development frameworks and compilers provide the capabilities to identify and map nested and transient dependencies.

This technique provides many benefits including the ability to automatically deploy updates to third-party components and resources without necessarily having to recompile code.<br><br>Unfortunately, there are some significant drawbacks to this approach. Third-party code repositories are heavily targeted by attackers because it enables them to potentially compromise numerous applications and entities by compromising a single package, library, script, or function. For example, if a malicious individual were able to compromise these repositories or otherwise replace a widely used JavaScript library with a modified version, then that malicious library could be automatically propagated to every user of that library without their knowledge.<br><br>To mitigate the risk of fetching malicious versions of code from third-party repositories, payment software vendors must validate the authenticity of such components before they are fetched (and/or loaded) by the calling application.<br><br>There are numerous ways in which this can be accomplished, but the most common method of verifying a component’s authenticity is through strong cryptography and digital signatures. |

Each time a user wants to perform a function or access application data, they submit a request to the application (usually through an API or similar) to access a particular function or resource. The software then processes that request and, if authorized, executes the requested function and/or returns the requested data.<br><br>It is often trivial for attackers to obtain login credentials of authorized users. A defense-in-depth strategy is essential to ensuring that only authorized users can access protected functions and resources.

Secure areas or systems are those within the software architecture where the integrity of available services and data is ensured, and therefore can be relied upon by the software.<br><br>Historically, web application architectures consisted of “client-side” components and “server-side” components. Client-side functions are those typically performed by a common web browser. Server-side functions are those typically performed by web, application, and/or database servers. Given the open nature and design of most common web browsers and the fact that they are maintained by end users, server-side functions are typically considered to be more secure given a software/service provider’s ability to control and secure those aspects of the software architecture.<br><br>Modern web software architectures, however, have become increasingly complex with software components often deployed across multiple geographic locations and managed by multiple entities. In these circumstances, the distinction between “client-side” or “server-side” functions can be increasingly ambiguous. The term “secure area” is a reference to traditional “server-side” functions without getting into architectural specifics. Examples of a secure area include a secured server environment, a microservice, or a serverless API. |

| **Control Objective C.3: Web Software Attack Mitigation**<br><br>Software security controls are implemented to mitigate common attacks on web applications. |     |     |
| **C.3.1** The software enforces or otherwise supports the use of the latest HTTP Security Headers to protect Internet accessible interfaces from attacks. | **C.3.1.a** The assessor shall examine evidence to confirm the software supports the use of the latest HTTP Security Headers, and to determine the options available and how such settings are configured. | HTTP Security Headers are a set of security-related configuration options available on most common web servers. Examples include the X-Frame-Options header, the HTTP-Strict-Transport-Security header, and the Content-Security-Policy header.<br><br>The use of these options can protect against a variety of different types of attacks including crosssite scripting, clickjacking, and cross-site request forgery attacks.<br><br>While support for specific HTTP Security Headers may differ depending on the underlying platform or software technology, these options are widely available and should be enabled and configured to the most secure configuration feasible for a given implementation. |
| **C.3.1.b** Where HTTP Security Headers are configured and controlled by the software provider, the assessor shall examine evidence to confirm that the software is configured to use the latest available HTTP Security Headers and that the configuration settings are reasonable and justified. |
| **C.3.1.c** Where user input or interaction is required to configure HTTP Security Headers, the assessor shall examine evidence to confirm that guidance is made available to stakeholders in accordance with Control Objective 12.1 that describes the HTTP Security Headers supported by the software and how to configure such settings. |
| **C.3.2** Input data from untrusted sources is never trusted and software security controls are implemented to mitigate the exploitation of vulnerabilities through the manipulation of input data. | **C.3.2.a** Using information obtained in Test Requirement C.2.1.a, the assessor shall examine evidence to identify all interfaces that accept data input from untrusted sources. | Many vulnerabilities in software and systems are exposed when input data supplied by an untrusted source is inherently trusted by the software and is processed without first ensuring the data is safe.<br><br>Untrusted sources are those that reside in a different security context than the API or system receiving and processing the input data. Examples of an untrusted source could include a system, API, or microservice residing in a different environment, an internal system that resides on the same network but is maintained under a lower security classification, or a user’s browser.<br><br>_(continued on next page)_ |
| **C.3.2.b** Where the software accepts input from untrusted sources, the assessor shall examine evidence to identify the data format(s) expected by the software for each input field and the parsers and interpreters involved in processing the input data. |

|     | **C.3.2.c** Using information obtained in Test Requirement 4.1.a in the Core Requirements section, the assessor shall examine evidence to determine whether attacks that target all such parsers and interpreters are acknowledged in the threat model. | Two of the most common types of attacks, Injection<br><br>(SQL, XML, Code, String, and so on) and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), exploit the software’s trust in input data provided by untrusted sources to execute malicious code or to force the software to behave in unintended ways.<br><br>To protect against these and other types of related attacks, input data must never be trusted, and software security controls must be implemented to ensure input data is validated, rendered safe, or otherwise handled in a manner that mitigates the likelihood and/or impacts of executing malicious input data. |
| **C.3.2.d** Where such attacks are acknowledged and using information obtained in Test Requirement 4.2.a in the Core Requirements section, the assessor shall examine evidence to confirm that software security controls are defined and implemented to mitigate attacks that attempt to exploit vulnerabilities through the manipulation of input data. |
| **C.3.2.e** Where the implementation of software security controls is configurable or otherwise requires user input or interaction, the assessor shall examine evidence to confirm that guidance is made available to stakeholders in accordance with Control Objective 12.1 that describes how to properly configure such security controls. |
| **C.3.2.1** Industry-standard methods are used to protect software inputs from attacks that attempt to exploit vulnerabilities through the manipulation of input data. | **C.3.2.1.a** Using information obtained in Test Requirement 4.2.a in the Core Requirements section, the assessor shall examine evidence to identify all software security controls implemented to mitigate attacks that attempt to exploit vulnerabilities through the manipulation of input data. | There are a variety of methods and techniques that may be used to protect software inputs from injection and other similar types of attacks. The method most often associated with such protections is “input validation.” Input validation, however, is difficult to implement correctly, particularly where complex input data, such as URLs, XML, JSON, serialized objects, and so on, are involved. Therefore, input validation is not appropriate as a primary defense against input manipulation attacks.<br><br>_(continued on next page)_ |
